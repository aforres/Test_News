        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - Duke Energy Florida, consumer representatives and business groups reached a comprehensive agreement that increases reliability and advances the clean energy vision for the state, while focusing on ways to assist and pass on savings to customers.
        If approved by the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC), the agreement will allow for an increase in base rates, among other provisions, yet the company still expects overall customer bills to decrease in January 2025, compared to January 2024. The 2022 fuel under-recovery, storm restoration cost recovery and some legacy purchased power contracts will expire by year-end 2024. The removal of these costs will lower customer bills.
        Duke Energy Florida has already reduced rates twice this year with reductions in January and June. Residential customers are paying approximately USD17 per 1,000 kWh less today, compared to one year ago.
        "Duke Energy Florida works hard to meet the unique needs of the diverse customers we serve. We remain committed to delivering on what customers want from us, their local utility," said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. "This agreement delivers the smarter, cleaner energy future customers deserve while prioritizing reliability and price stability."
        If approved, the base rate changes are estimated to result in an average annual 2% bill increase over the three-year period. This is composed of USD203 million and USD59 million in base rate increases in January of 2025 and 2026, respectively, as well as increases associated with 12 new solar facilities as they come on-line, estimated at USD12 million, USD71 million and USD58 million in 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively.  
        Based on current projections, Duke Energy Florida expects a typical residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours to see a decrease in their January 2025 bill of USD8.26, a 5% decrease when compared to December 2024.
        This collaborative agreement will allow Duke Energy Florida to continue making investments to reduce outages, shorten response times, meet future energy demands, increase clean, solar generation and explore innovative technologies to generate cost savings for its 2 million customers in Florida. 
        Among other provisions, the agreement provides flexibility for Florida's most vulnerable customers during times of need and extreme weather events, including suspending disconnects for nonpayment of Duke Energy Florida bills when actual temperatures reach 95 degrees or greater. The company will also work to increase participation in its Neighborhood Energy Saver program by 10% and to increase the installation of smart thermostats from 10% to 40% for income-qualified customers.
        Duke Energy Florida developed the agreement collaboratively with customer representatives of several consumer groups, including the state's Office of Public Counsel, Florida Industrial Power Users Group, PCS Phosphate Company, Inc., Nucor Corporation and Florida Retail Federation.

        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - Air Products (NYSE: APD), a leading global industrial gases company and world-leader in hydrogen supply, has been awarded an  'A' rating on MSCI's environmental, social and governance (ESG) Ratings.
        The 'A' rating by MSCI was based on Air Products' improvements in its carbon management strategy, including carbon capture efforts, its announced goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions from operations by 2050, and other sustainability initiatives. In its review, MSCI rated Air Products an ESG leader in its industry in two categories: clean tech, and safety and health.
        "Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do at Air Products. We believe we have a critical role to play in addressing the significant sustainability and environmental challenges facing our world, and that is why Air Products has committed to invest USD15 billion in first-mover, world-scale clean energy projects to accelerate the energy transition," said Seifi Ghasemi, Air Products' Chairman, President and CEO. "We are pleased with this rating from MSCI and will continue to work hard every day to provide excellent service to our customers and innovate solutions while generating a cleaner future."
        MSCI ESG Ratings measure a company's management of financially relevant ESG risks and opportunities. MSCI uses a rules-based methodology to identify industry leaders and laggards according to their exposure to ESG risks and how well a company manages those risks relative to peers.
        The MSCI rating is the latest recognition for Air Products' ESG efforts. Earlier this year, Air Products was again included on Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies List. Recently, Air Products was listed in S&P Global's Sustainability Yearbook for 2024 for the 12th time. Air Products also was recognized by Newsweek as one of America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity in 2024.

st.subheader("""Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) Market Size to Hit USD 32.4 billion by 2034, at a 5.7% CAGR | Analysis by Transparency Market Research, Inc.
""")
st.markdown("""
        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - The fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) market was projected to attain  USD 17.6 million in 2023. It is likely to garner a 5.7% CAGR from 2024 to 2034, and by 2034, the market is expected to attain  USD 32.4 billion.
        FAME is increasingly being used in traditional petrochemical applications, including as solvents and intermediates in various chemical processes. Exploring non-food feedstocks, such as algae and jatropha, can reduce the reliance on traditional agricultural feedstocks and mitigate the food vs. fuel debate.
        Increasing consumer awareness and preference for green and sustainable products create new markets for FAME-based products, including lubricants, surfactants, and detergents.
        Continued investment in research and development can lead to breakthroughs in production processes, making FAME more competitive with traditional petrochemical products. Government policies promoting the cultivation of oilseed crops can significantly influence the FAME market by ensuring a steady supply of raw materials.
        The need for energy security and reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels is motivating many countries to invest in biofuels, including FAME. Advances in catalyst technologies can enhance the efficiency of the transesterification process, reducing production costs and increasing the yield of FAME.
        Many countries have implemented mandates requiring the blending of biodiesel with conventional diesel, directly boosting the demand for FAME. Participation in carbon trading schemes can provide financial incentives for the production and use of biodiesel, indirectly benefiting the FAME market.

John Barrasso (R-WY), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Joe Manchin (I-WV)   and U.S. Congresswoman Harriet Hageman (R-WY). Staff representatives for Senators Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) also attended.
        The Ramaco Research Rodeo, or R3, is the world's leading research conference focused on coal-to-products research, rare earth element exploration, artificial intelligence, and critical minerals. Now in its fourth year, the conference was held in Sheridan, and hosted by coal, critical mineral, and carbon technology company Ramaco Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ: METC), in partnership with the International Centre for Sustainable Carbon, a technology collaboration program organized under the auspices of the Paris-based International Energy Agency.
        In his opening remarks on the event's first day, Sen. Barrasso praised event attendees for their research and hard work. 
        "This conference brings together innovative minds to share and discuss research on new energy technologies," said Sen. Barrasso, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Energy Committee. "Our nation's ability to develop these technologies is key to our energy security, and there's no better place in the country to find energy resources than Wyoming.
        "Some in this country mistakenly believe that coal has no place in the future. They're wrong.   Coal has other potential uses in addition to electricity generation. Researchers are discovering new ways to transform coal-derived carbon into everyday materials. These include asphalt, graphite, and carbon fiber. Coal has also shown itself to be a source of rare earth elements. These elements are important to both the energy and defense sectors," Barrasso said.
        The event highlighted advances in scientific research and new uses for coal as a feedstock for high-value products and materials. Rep. Hageman focused on this work in her remarks.
        "Ramaco and other research groups, working with the Department of Energy's national labs, has opened up exciting new areas of possibly using coal to be the precursor for a host of advanced carbon products and materials, which could change the landscape on important new materials like synthetic graphite activated carbon fibers, graphene, and other 21st century carbon products," said Hageman.
        Sen. Manchin praised Ramaco's work in developing critical minerals, both in terms of metallurgical coal for steel, as well as the rare earth element deposit it is exploring in Wyoming.

st.subheader("""From Smart Labels to Wearables: IDTechEx Explores the Limits of Flexible Battery Applications
""")
st.markdown("""
        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - Since the conception of flexible battery technologies, suppliers have searched for strong application markets for their products. In the last five years, niches have finally begun to materialize, though the specific use case depends on battery technology. Some of the earliest examples of commercialized flexible batteries were thin-film solid-state micro-power batteries that used the LiPON electrolyte developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In the last decade, other flexible battery options have been semi-commercialized, including zinc-carbon, zinc-silver, and primary lithium chemistries. Bulk solid-state and advanced lithium-ion technologies are now also on the brink of commercialization, and opportunities for their products are being searched for. IDTechEx's latest report, "Flexible Batteries Market 2025-2035: Technologies, Forecasts, and Players", includes an in-depth analysis of flexible battery applications and technologies, as well as a market valuation and a 10-year forecast.
        Two broad categories of flexible battery technology can be identified as lower and higher capacity. To the first belongs thin-film and micro-battery technologies: zinc-carbon, zinc-silver, primary lithium, and thin-film solid-state. Of these, zinc-carbon, zinc-silver, and thin-film solid-state may be rechargeable or non-rechargeable, while primary lithium is always non-rechargeable. Printing is the most common manufacturing method for zinc chemistries, while lithium chemistries use alternative manufacturing methods such as sputtering. They are defined either by their chemistry (zinc-carbon, zinc-silver, primary lithium) or by their electrolyte (thin-film solid-state). All are expensive to scale up in terms of size and capacity, and their areal energy density is limited, making them best suited for micro-power applications.
        The second category includes advanced lithium-ion and bulk solid-state technologies  the less mature flexible battery technologies. Both are based on rechargeable lithium-ion technologies. Advanced lithium-ion, in this case, describes a battery structure that is similar in chemistry to traditional lithium-ion cells but with innovations that enhance flexibility, e.g., cell packaging or electrolyte. Both liquid electrolyte batteries and semi-solid polymer electrolyte batteries can be included in this category. Bulk solid-state describes a non-thin battery with a solid-state electrolyte, though it need not be 100% solid. Examples of solid-state electrolytes include ceramics and sulfides.
        The advantages of flexible batteries are self-evident. A battery that can be rolled, stretched, and bent without losing functionality could prove a significant advantage in the right use case. However, flexible batteries are competing with significantly cheaper traditional technologies such as coin cells. For comparison, coin cells can be less than  USD0.50/Wh, while the cheapest flexible battery options are around  USD3/Wh. In fact, some technologies cost tens of dollars per Wh. In most use cases, the price of flexible batteries is too high to warrant their use. Instead, suppliers have needed to find niches where extreme flexibility is required, and which are relatively price-insensitive, high-end, specific form-factor applications.
        Smart labels have become the primary niche for the first category of low-capacity batteries. Thin batteries, usually printed, are integrated into labels, tags, and sensors that are used for quality control and logistics in industry settings. For example, RFID tags with temperature sensors or chemical sensors are used to monitor produce. The advantage of these tags is significant   produce that would otherwise be lost in transit due to poor temperature control can be saved, reducing waste. Other types of smart labels are used to communicate the position and condition of shipments. Not all smart labels use flexible batteries, however increasingly flexible battery companies have targeted this application. Thinness is the major driver of flexible battery uptake in this instance. Thin labels require thin batteries, which happen to be flexible. While flexibility is an advantage when the label is applied to a curved or irregular surface, in most cases, it is not a requirement. Zinergy and CCL Design (after the acquisition of Imprint Energy) are two flexible battery players who have increasingly targeted this niche. The flexible battery market for smart labels and RFID tags is valued at  USD14.3 million in 2025 and is expected to grow with a CAGR of 23.9% over the next decade.
        Meanwhile, companies supplying the second category of higher-capacity batteries are increasingly focusing on wearables applications. Wearables include a diverse range of products, from hearables and smartwatches to XR headwear and e-textiles. Unlike consumer electronics, products worn on the body frequently require tailored form factors as they must be comfortable when worn. As a result, wearables companies have shown interest in curved and flexible battery options in the past as a means of removing unnecessary bulk. However, the flexible batteries of the past were unable to meet wearable product requirements for energy density and lifetime. Only recently has flexible battery supply begun to align with the demand for wearables.
        Advanced lithium-ion and bulk solid-state flexible batteries have begun to move from the development stage into semi-commercialization, finally providing energy storage solutions that can meet energy density and lifetime requirements while still retaining a flexible form factor. Suppliers of both technologies have targeted wearables opportunities, especially wrist-worn wearables and electronic headwear. Low-end, mass-produced hearables and wrist-worn wearables make up the largest proportion of the overall wearables market but present no opportunity for flexible batteries, and the high cost of flexible battery options cannot be justified for low-cost, mass-produced products. However, the wearables market still presents significant opportunities at the high end. LiBEST, for example, is a Korean company that, since 2024, has focused on advanced lithium-ion batteries for XR headsets and high-end hearables, where products are price-insensitive, and bulkiness is not favored. The total wearables market for flexible batteries (which includes skin patches) is valued at  USD43.3 million in 2025 and is expected to grow with a CAGR of 21.6% over the next decade.

        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - Legal-Bay LLC, the premier Pre Settlement Funding Company, reports that they are seeing an uptick in lawsuits against negligent pyrotechnicians and residential homeowners in the wake of the 4th of July holiday. Fireworks injuries and property damages join the escalating lawsuits that have been filed due to building explosions at gas stations, chemical plants, and oil refineries, falling under such categories as worker's comp, premises liability, personal injury, wrongful death, and beyond.  
        Explosion lawsuits are filed more often than one would think. Whether in a place of business or a residential property, danger lurks for victims of others' negligence. Accidental gas leaks or faulty propane tanks are probably the most well-known type of house or building explosion, but sometimes, negligent installation by inexperienced workers or business owners looking to cut corners can lead to disaster. Likewise, if a person is injured or their property is damaged by fireworks whether from a professional show or a neighbor's backyard they are entitled to compensation.
        Explosion payouts obviously vary depending on the severity of the damage caused and extent of injuries. Just last year, for example, a New Jersey man who suffered severe burns from an explosion while working on an electrical panel in 2019 sued his employer for gross negligence. The man was instructed to work on the electric panel even though he was not a licensed electrician. The resulting explosion inflicted burns over half of his body, requiring over 100 surgeries and a lifetime of future care. He was awarded USD28MM for pain, suffering, and loss of ability to earn a salary.
        Chris Janish, CEO of Legal-Bay, commented, "Extreme explosions can result in chemical burns, broken bones, and sometimes even death, not to mention the environmental impact and property damage that can occur. Legal Bay stands at the ready to assist victims of any type of explosion get the money they have coming to them."
        If you or a loved one was seriously injured or killed in an explosion, you may have grounds for a lawsuit. To apply for a cash advance lawsuit loan from your anticipated lawsuit settlement, please visit the company's website HERE or call 877.571.0405 where agents are standing by to hear about your specific case.  
        Legal-Bay is one of the best lawsuit loan companies in the industry. They assist plaintiffs in all types of class action and mass tort lawsuits, including: Round Up, JUUL e-cigarettes, 3M, Hernia Mesh, IVC Filters, Roundup, Essure, Exactech hip and knee recall, and more.
        Legal-Bay assists plaintiffs in all other types of lawsuits, including personal injury, slips and falls, car, boat, or construction accidents, medical malpractice, wrongful death, dog bites, police brutality, sexual assault, sexual abuse, judgment or verdict on appeal, commercial litigation, contract dispute, Qui-tam or whistleblower cases, False Claims Act, patent litigation, copyright infringement, and more.
        Legal-Bay's loan for settlement funding programs are designed to provide immediate cash in advance of a plaintiff's anticipated monetary award. While it's common to refer to these legal funding requests as settlement loans, loans for settlements, law suit loans, loans for lawsuits, etc., the "lawsuit loan" funds are, in fact, non-recourse. That means there's no risk when it comes to loans in lawsuit settlements because there is no obligation to repay the money if the recipient loses their case. Therefore, terms like settlement loan, loans for lawsuit, loans on settlement, or lawsuit loan funds don't necessarily apply, as the "loan on lawsuit" isn't really a loan at all, but rather a stress-free cash advance.

st.subheader("""Bleaching Clay Market to Double in Value to USUSD 2.16 Billion by 2034, Propelled by 7.3% CAGR
""")
st.markdown("""
        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - The global Bleaching Clay Market is projected to be valued at  USD 2.16 billion by 2034, up from  USD 1.07 billion in 2024. Based on this updated industry research released by Fact.MR, the market has been forecasted to expand at a CAGR of 7.3% from 2024 to 2034.
        The most common kind of clay that works well for decolorizing and purifying oils and fats is bleaching clay, which has a comparatively high adsorption capacity. The main source material for bleaching clay is montmorillonite, referred to as hydrated aluminum silicates, which gives bleaching clay its crucial adsorption qualities.
        Natural bleaching clays have been applied for the refining of edible oils and fats since the early nineteenth century; however, the activation process improves its properties, which include its adsorptive, acid, catalytic, and ion exchange capacities. A broad range of contaminants, such as carotenes and chlorophylls, as well as more complex contaminants, including soaps, oxidation products, and metals, can be found in vegetable and mineral oils. These impurities are effectively eliminated by activated bleaching clay, which also enhances the appearance and flavor of these oils.
        North America and East Asia, together, are estimated to account for well over half of global bleaching clay sales. Fuller's earth is the most popular kind and accounts for around one-third share of the global market.
        "Companies will continue to invest in capacity expansion and new product development in the years ahead to meet increasing and changing demands in this market," says a Fact.MR analyst.

""")
st.markdown("""
        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - In a shipyard in Yingkou, a coastal city in China's northeastern Liaoning Province, XCMG Crane, a subsidiary of XCMG Machinery unveiled its 4,000-tonne crawler crane, the XGC88000, now configured with a luffing jib. This crane has achieved a milestone by successfully lifting an 18MW offshore wind turbine, marking its first foray into this application. The achievement sets global records for both the diameter and the power per unit of the turbine, signaling its readiness for commercial deployment.
        The 18 MW offshore wind turbine, weighing close to 800 tonnes, features a hub center height of 145 meters and a blade tip height of nearly 270 meters. At optimal wind speeds, it generates 44 kWh of electricity per revolution. Annually, a single turbine can produce approx. 74 million kWh of clean electricity, sufficient to meet the energy needs of 40,000 households. This is equivalent to saving about 25,000 tonnes of standard coal and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by approx. 60,000 tonnes each year.
        To address the ultra-high, super-heavy, and high precision requirements of the project, XCMG has, for the first time, utilized the XGC88000 crawler crane in luffing jib working conditions. This marks the first instance within the industry that a 4,000-tonne crane has been applied in such conditions.
        The installation of the world's longest blade, measuring 126 meters, represents a challenging and critical phase in the entire lifting process. The task is akin to threading a needle at high altitudes, requiring the precise insertion of more than 170 bolts into their corresponding holes in the hub at nearly 150 meters above ground. Additionally, the blade is subject to swaying due to sea breezes during the installation, posing a risk of damage if not carefully managed. These factors combined to make the lifting operation extremely challenging.
        The XGC88000 performed reliably, and with the support of auxiliary cranes, the processes of lifting, slewing, centering, and positioning were executed smoothly and efficiently. This operation was accomplished in one attempt and earned unanimous praise from both the project owner and the construction crews.

        According to section 4A.2 of Regulation 51-102 Respecting Continuous Disclosure Obligations, forward-looking information should not be disclosed unless the issuer has a reasonable basis for the forward-looking information. Following a review of the Company's news release dated March 12, 2024, the Autorit  des march s financiers (Qu bec) has the view that the issuer does not have such reasonable basis for the forward-looking information.
        Accordingly, in order to comply with section 4A.2 of Regulation 51-102, the Company retracts from its news release dated March 12, 2024, the forward-looking information as to the supply of raw materials and the information flowing therefrom.
        Readers are cautioned that the term "pre-feasibility study" used by the Company to refer to this Study is not the same as the one used for mineral projects as defined under National Instrument 43-101 respecting standards of disclosure for mineral projects ("NI 43-101"), and this Study should therefore not be viewed as equating to a "pre-feasibility study" as defined under NI 43-101 because the Project is not a mineral project but rather an industrial project and therefore is not governed by NI 43-101.

""")
st.markdown("""
        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - Inhance Technologies welcomes the opportunity to engage with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding today's announcement that EPA will commence a proceeding under Section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to further evaluate the fluorination of plastic containers. In particular, EPA has stated its intent to solicit information on this technology, including how fluorinated containers are used and whether measures may be appropriate to address any potential risk due to minute impurities of some perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that may be generated by use of the technology. Nothing in EPA's announcement indicates that the agency has made a decision to ban or restrict the fluorination of plastic containers or the sale or use of such containers.
        Inhance Technologies will work with EPA, along with others in the industry, to provide information about the fluorination of plastic containers. We are confident that Inhance Technologies' fluorination technology does not present a risk to the public or the environment. In fact, fluorination of plastic containers provides important benefits to the national economy. For example, as compared to other barrier technologies, fluorination is less resource intensive and has a lower carbon footprint. Additionally, the strong and consistent barrier provided by the fluorination process also prevents human and environmental exposure to volatile chemicals that are stored in fluorinated articles during transportation, storage, and use.
        EPA took this action in response to a citizen petition, filed by environmental groups, that seeks an immediate ban on the use of fluorination of plastic containers based on the baseless allegations that the technology poses an unreasonable risk. These environmental groups seek to deny access to fluorinated containers, which are critical to many industries from healthcare to crop protection, and whose supply chain partners would be left without viable alternatives for effective barrier protection, including for applications such as vaccines, pesticides, and fuel systems.

st.subheader("""RFA: Study Shows That Allowing E15 Fuel Blend Could Save California Drivers USD2.7 Billion at the Pump Annually
""")
st.markdown("""
        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - A new study by economists at UC Berkeley and the U.S. Naval Academy found California drivers could expect to save 20 cents per gallon if the state allowed gas stations to sell E15 fuel   a blend of 15 percent ethanol and 85 percent gasoline approved in all 49 other states.
        The potential savings for California consumers could reach USD2.7 billion annually, according to the study authored by David Zilberman, PhD, a distinguished professor in the Agricultural and Resources Economics Department at UC Berkeley, and Scott Kaplan, PhD, assistant professor in the Economics Department at the United States Naval Academy.
        "Consumers have the potential to gain significantly from the introduction and purchase of E15," according to the study. "In particular, our estimates suggest an approximately 20 cents per gallon discount for E15 compared with E10 after adjusting for energy content." The authors also highlighted the benefit of E15's lower carbon emissions. "In California, price savings for lower GHG intensity fuels are larger, likely due to California-specific policies incentivizing low carbon fuels."
        California is the last remaining state to limit ethanol inclusion in gasoline to just 10 percent (E10), but state regulators are considering approval of E15 after extensive vehicle testing showed the fuel offers important emissions benefits. E15 is legally approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use in all cars, pickups, SUVs and vans manufactured in the last 24 years.
        The study, sponsored by the Renewable Fuels Association, details the economic viability and implications of adopting E15 in California by analyzing fuel characteristics, market dynamics, and regulatory influences. Beyond direct cost savings, researchers found that increased use of ethanol-blend biofuels lowers gasoline usage, enhances energy security and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
        "Based on this study's results, a typical California household could save USD200 per year on their gas bill if state regulators would simply allow drivers to fuel up on E15," said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper, noting that more than 24 million registered vehicles in California are already approved to use E15, but stations are not allowed to sell it. "It's time for California to catch up to the other 49 states that already allow consumers to choose lower-cost, lower-carbon E15. The state's failure to approve the use of E15 essentially amounts to a gas price hike at a time when hardworking Californians can least afford it."
        The study also found that "low-income commuters may stand to gain the most from a transition towards E15," given their propensity to have longer commutes and less fuel-efficient vehicles.
        An earlier study commissioned by the California Air Resources Board found that adopting E15 in California could also provide significant environmental benefits, cutting emissions of tailpipe pollutants like particulate matter and carbon monoxide that cause air quality and human health problems.

        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - Silvercorp Metals Inc. ("Silvercorp" or the "Company") (TSX: SVM) (NYSE American: SVM) reports production and sales figures for the first quarter ended June 30, 2024 of fiscal 2025 ("Q1 Fiscal 2025"). The Company expects to release its Q1 Fiscal 2025 audited financial results on Tuesday, August 13, 2024, after market close.
        In Q1 Fiscal 2025, a total of 256,079 tonnes of ore were mined at the Ying Mining District, up 20% over Q1 Fiscal 2024, and 221,242 tonnes of ore were milled, up 6% over Q1 Fiscal 2024. Approximately 1,146 ounces of gold, 1.6 million ounces of silver, (or 1.7 million ounces of silver equivalent), 14.1 million pounds of lead, and 2.5 million pounds of zinc were produced, representing a production increase of 17% in zinc and decreases of 26%, 2%, 4%, and 8%, respectively, in gold, silver, silver equivalent, and lead over Q1 Fiscal 2024. Ore head grades were in line with the Company's Fiscal 2025 annual guidance. The decrease of silver, gold and lead is mainly due to i) lower head grades realized as per the current mine plan and ii) a total of 59,293 tonnes of stockpile ores not yet processed. The Company expects that the stockpiled ore will be processed in the third and fourth quarter, once the No. 2 mill capacity expansion of 1,500 tonnes per day is achieved in the third quarter of Fiscal 2025.
        At the GC Mine, 87,768 tonnes of ore were mined, down 2% over Q1 Fiscal 2024, and 86,454 tonnes of ore were milled, effectively the same compared to Q1 Fiscal 2024. Approximately 145 thousand ounces of silver, 1.5 million pounds of lead, and 4.0 million pounds of zinc were produced, representing decreases of 21%, 37% and 16%, respectively, in silver, lead and zinc over Q1 Fiscal 2024. The decrease in metal production was mainly due to lower head grades achieved and less ore processed.
        Silvercorp is a Canadian mining company producing silver, gold, lead, and zinc with a long history of profitability and growth potential. The Company's strategy is to create shareholder value by 1) focusing on generating free cash flow from long life mines; 2) organic growth through extensive drilling for discovery; 3) ongoing merger and acquisition efforts to unlock value; and 4) long term commitment to responsible mining and ESG.

        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - Duke Energy Florida, consumer representatives and business groups reached a comprehensive agreement that increases reliability and advances the clean energy vision for the state, while focusing on ways to assist and pass on savings to customers.
        If approved by the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC), the agreement will allow for an increase in base rates, among other provisions, yet the company still expects overall customer bills to decrease in January 2025, compared to January 2024. The 2022 fuel under-recovery, storm restoration cost recovery and some legacy purchased power contracts will expire by year-end 2024. The removal of these costs will lower customer bills.
        Duke Energy Florida has already reduced rates twice this year with reductions in January and June. Residential customers are paying approximately USD17 per 1,000 kWh less today, compared to one year ago.
        "Duke Energy Florida works hard to meet the unique needs of the diverse customers we serve. We remain committed to delivering on what customers want from us, their local utility," said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. "This agreement delivers the smarter, cleaner energy future customers deserve while prioritizing reliability and price stability."
        If approved, the base rate changes are estimated to result in an average annual 2% bill increase over the three-year period. This is composed of USD203 million and USD59 million in base rate increases in January of 2025 and 2026, respectively, as well as increases associated with 12 new solar facilities as they come on-line, estimated at USD12 million, USD71 million and USD58 million in 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively.  
        Based on current projections, Duke Energy Florida expects a typical residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours to see a decrease in their January 2025 bill of USD8.26, a 5% decrease when compared to December 2024.
        This collaborative agreement will allow Duke Energy Florida to continue making investments to reduce outages, shorten response times, meet future energy demands, increase clean, solar generation and explore innovative technologies to generate cost savings for its 2 million customers in Florida. 
        Among other provisions, the agreement provides flexibility for Florida's most vulnerable customers during times of need and extreme weather events, including suspending disconnects for nonpayment of Duke Energy Florida bills when actual temperatures reach 95 degrees or greater. The company will also work to increase participation in its Neighborhood Energy Saver program by 10% and to increase the installation of smart thermostats from 10% to 40% for income-qualified customers.
        Duke Energy Florida developed the agreement collaboratively with customer representatives of several consumer groups, including the state's Office of Public Counsel, Florida Industrial Power Users Group, PCS Phosphate Company, Inc., Nucor Corporation and Florida Retail Federation.

        -  The global agricultural biologicals market, including biofertilizers and biostimulants, faces hindrances due to insufficient awareness among farmers, particularly in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa. Economic sustainability, eco-friendliness, political obligation, practical viability, and social acceptability are crucial factors influencing the adoption of updated agricultural practices. However, the lack of understanding regarding the advantages of biological products and misconceptions about their potential health hazards hinder their use. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the adoption of biofertilizers is significantly lower than in developed countries and some Asian regions. This is due to the absence of effective regulations, limited infrastructure, and insufficient skills, resulting in low availability and adoption of these products. Similarly, farmers in the region are unaware of the benefits of biostimulants for crop nutrition. To promote the growth and adoption of agricultural biologicals, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a need for governmental support, investment in localized research, involvement of the public and private sector, and increased awareness of the products. Effective regulations, streamlined registration processes, and improved marketing efforts can also help overcome the current challenges and unlock the vast potential of these products in enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability.

John Barrasso (R-WY), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Joe Manchin (I-WV)   and U.S. Congresswoman Harriet Hageman (R-WY). Staff representatives for Senators Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) also attended.
        The Ramaco Research Rodeo, or R3, is the world's leading research conference focused on coal-to-products research, rare earth element exploration, artificial intelligence, and critical minerals. Now in its fourth year, the conference was held in Sheridan, and hosted by coal, critical mineral, and carbon technology company Ramaco Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ: METC), in partnership with the International Centre for Sustainable Carbon, a technology collaboration program organized under the auspices of the Paris-based International Energy Agency.
        In his opening remarks on the event's first day, Sen. Barrasso praised event attendees for their research and hard work. 
        "This conference brings together innovative minds to share and discuss research on new energy technologies," said Sen. Barrasso, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Energy Committee. "Our nation's ability to develop these technologies is key to our energy security, and there's no better place in the country to find energy resources than Wyoming.
        "Some in this country mistakenly believe that coal has no place in the future. They're wrong.   Coal has other potential uses in addition to electricity generation. Researchers are discovering new ways to transform coal-derived carbon into everyday materials. These include asphalt, graphite, and carbon fiber. Coal has also shown itself to be a source of rare earth elements. These elements are important to both the energy and defense sectors," Barrasso said.
        The event highlighted advances in scientific research and new uses for coal as a feedstock for high-value products and materials. Rep. Hageman focused on this work in her remarks.

st.subheader("""From Smart Labels to Wearables: IDTechEx Explores the Limits of Flexible Battery Applications
""")
st.markdown("""
        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - Since the conception of flexible battery technologies, suppliers have searched for strong application markets for their products. In the last five years, niches have finally begun to materialize, though the specific use case depends on battery technology. Some of the earliest examples of commercialized flexible batteries were thin-film solid-state micro-power batteries that used the LiPON electrolyte developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In the last decade, other flexible battery options have been semi-commercialized, including zinc-carbon, zinc-silver, and primary lithium chemistries. Bulk solid-state and advanced lithium-ion technologies are now also on the brink of commercialization, and opportunities for their products are being searched for. IDTechEx's latest report, "Flexible Batteries Market 2025-2035: Technologies, Forecasts, and Players", includes an in-depth analysis of flexible battery applications and technologies, as well as a market valuation and a 10-year forecast.
        Two broad categories of flexible battery technology can be identified as lower and higher capacity. To the first belongs thin-film and micro-battery technologies: zinc-carbon, zinc-silver, primary lithium, and thin-film solid-state. Of these, zinc-carbon, zinc-silver, and thin-film solid-state may be rechargeable or non-rechargeable, while primary lithium is always non-rechargeable. Printing is the most common manufacturing method for zinc chemistries, while lithium chemistries use alternative manufacturing methods such as sputtering. They are defined either by their chemistry (zinc-carbon, zinc-silver, primary lithium) or by their electrolyte (thin-film solid-state). All are expensive to scale up in terms of size and capacity, and their areal energy density is limited, making them best suited for micro-power applications.
        The second category includes advanced lithium-ion and bulk solid-state technologies  the less mature flexible battery technologies. Both are based on rechargeable lithium-ion technologies. Advanced lithium-ion, in this case, describes a battery structure that is similar in chemistry to traditional lithium-ion cells but with innovations that enhance flexibility, e.g., cell packaging or electrolyte. Both liquid electrolyte batteries and semi-solid polymer electrolyte batteries can be included in this category. Bulk solid-state describes a non-thin battery with a solid-state electrolyte, though it need not be 100% solid. Examples of solid-state electrolytes include ceramics and sulfides.
        The advantages of flexible batteries are self-evident. A battery that can be rolled, stretched, and bent without losing functionality could prove a significant advantage in the right use case. However, flexible batteries are competing with significantly cheaper traditional technologies such as coin cells. For comparison, coin cells can be less than  USD0.50/Wh, while the cheapest flexible battery options are around  USD3/Wh. In fact, some technologies cost tens of dollars per Wh. In most use cases, the price of flexible batteries is too high to warrant their use. Instead, suppliers have needed to find niches where extreme flexibility is required, and which are relatively price-insensitive, high-end, specific form-factor applications.
        Smart labels have become the primary niche for the first category of low-capacity batteries. Thin batteries, usually printed, are integrated into labels, tags, and sensors that are used for quality control and logistics in industry settings. For example, RFID tags with temperature sensors or chemical sensors are used to monitor produce. The advantage of these tags is significant   produce that would otherwise be lost in transit due to poor temperature control can be saved, reducing waste. Other types of smart labels are used to communicate the position and condition of shipments. Not all smart labels use flexible batteries, however increasingly flexible battery companies have targeted this application. Thinness is the major driver of flexible battery uptake in this instance. Thin labels require thin batteries, which happen to be flexible. While flexibility is an advantage when the label is applied to a curved or irregular surface, in most cases, it is not a requirement. Zinergy and CCL Design (after the acquisition of Imprint Energy) are two flexible battery players who have increasingly targeted this niche. The flexible battery market for smart labels and RFID tags is valued at  USD14.3 million in 2025 and is expected to grow with a CAGR of 23.9% over the next decade.
        Meanwhile, companies supplying the second category of higher-capacity batteries are increasingly focusing on wearables applications. Wearables include a diverse range of products, from hearables and smartwatches to XR headwear and e-textiles. Unlike consumer electronics, products worn on the body frequently require tailored form factors as they must be comfortable when worn. As a result, wearables companies have shown interest in curved and flexible battery options in the past as a means of removing unnecessary bulk. However, the flexible batteries of the past were unable to meet wearable product requirements for energy density and lifetime. Only recently has flexible battery supply begun to align with the demand for wearables.
        Advanced lithium-ion and bulk solid-state flexible batteries have begun to move from the development stage into semi-commercialization, finally providing energy storage solutions that can meet energy density and lifetime requirements while still retaining a flexible form factor. Suppliers of both technologies have targeted wearables opportunities, especially wrist-worn wearables and electronic headwear. Low-end, mass-produced hearables and wrist-worn wearables make up the largest proportion of the overall wearables market but present no opportunity for flexible batteries, and the high cost of flexible battery options cannot be justified for low-cost, mass-produced products. However, the wearables market still presents significant opportunities at the high end. LiBEST, for example, is a Korean company that, since 2024, has focused on advanced lithium-ion batteries for XR headsets and high-end hearables, where products are price-insensitive, and bulkiness is not favored. The total wearables market for flexible batteries (which includes skin patches) is valued at  USD43.3 million in 2025 and is expected to grow with a CAGR of 21.6% over the next decade.

st.markdown("""
        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - Legal-Bay LLC, the premier Pre Settlement Funding Company, reports that they are seeing an uptick in lawsuits against negligent pyrotechnicians and residential homeowners in the wake of the 4th of July holiday. Fireworks injuries and property damages join the escalating lawsuits that have been filed due to building explosions at gas stations, chemical plants, and oil refineries, falling under such categories as worker's comp, premises liability, personal injury, wrongful death, and beyond.  
        Explosion lawsuits are filed more often than one would think. Whether in a place of business or a residential property, danger lurks for victims of others' negligence. Accidental gas leaks or faulty propane tanks are probably the most well-known type of house or building explosion, but sometimes, negligent installation by inexperienced workers or business owners looking to cut corners can lead to disaster. Likewise, if a person is injured or their property is damaged by fireworks whether from a professional show or a neighbor's backyard they are entitled to compensation.
        Explosion payouts obviously vary depending on the severity of the damage caused and extent of injuries. Just last year, for example, a New Jersey man who suffered severe burns from an explosion while working on an electrical panel in 2019 sued his employer for gross negligence. The man was instructed to work on the electric panel even though he was not a licensed electrician. The resulting explosion inflicted burns over half of his body, requiring over 100 surgeries and a lifetime of future care. He was awarded USD28MM for pain, suffering, and loss of ability to earn a salary.
        Chris Janish, CEO of Legal-Bay, commented, "Extreme explosions can result in chemical burns, broken bones, and sometimes even death, not to mention the environmental impact and property damage that can occur. Legal Bay stands at the ready to assist victims of any type of explosion get the money they have coming to them."
        If you or a loved one was seriously injured or killed in an explosion, you may have grounds for a lawsuit. To apply for a cash advance lawsuit loan from your anticipated lawsuit settlement, please visit the company's website HERE or call 877.571.0405 where agents are standing by to hear about your specific case.  
        Legal-Bay is one of the best lawsuit loan companies in the industry. They assist plaintiffs in all types of class action and mass tort lawsuits, including: Round Up, JUUL e-cigarettes, 3M, Hernia Mesh, IVC Filters, Roundup, Essure, Exactech hip and knee recall, and more.
        Legal-Bay assists plaintiffs in all other types of lawsuits, including personal injury, slips and falls, car, boat, or construction accidents, medical malpractice, wrongful death, dog bites, police brutality, sexual assault, sexual abuse, judgment or verdict on appeal, commercial litigation, contract dispute, Qui-tam or whistleblower cases, False Claims Act, patent litigation, copyright infringement, and more.
        Legal-Bay's loan for settlement funding programs are designed to provide immediate cash in advance of a plaintiff's anticipated monetary award. While it's common to refer to these legal funding requests as settlement loans, loans for settlements, law suit loans, loans for lawsuits, etc., the "lawsuit loan" funds are, in fact, non-recourse. That means there's no risk when it comes to loans in lawsuit settlements because there is no obligation to repay the money if the recipient loses their case. Therefore, terms like settlement loan, loans for lawsuit, loans on settlement, or lawsuit loan funds don't necessarily apply, as the "loan on lawsuit" isn't really a loan at all, but rather a stress-free cash advance.

st.subheader("""Bleaching Clay Market to Double in Value to USUSD 2.16 Billion by 2034, Propelled by 7.3% CAGR
""")
st.markdown("""
        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - The global Bleaching Clay Market is projected to be valued at  USD 2.16 billion by 2034, up from  USD 1.07 billion in 2024. Based on this updated industry research released by Fact.MR, the market has been forecasted to expand at a CAGR of 7.3% from 2024 to 2034.
        The most common kind of clay that works well for decolorizing and purifying oils and fats is bleaching clay, which has a comparatively high adsorption capacity. The main source material for bleaching clay is montmorillonite, referred to as hydrated aluminum silicates, which gives bleaching clay its crucial adsorption qualities.
        Natural bleaching clays have been applied for the refining of edible oils and fats since the early nineteenth century; however, the activation process improves its properties, which include its adsorptive, acid, catalytic, and ion exchange capacities. A broad range of contaminants, such as carotenes and chlorophylls, as well as more complex contaminants, including soaps, oxidation products, and metals, can be found in vegetable and mineral oils. These impurities are effectively eliminated by activated bleaching clay, which also enhances the appearance and flavor of these oils.
        North America and East Asia, together, are estimated to account for well over half of global bleaching clay sales. Fuller's earth is the most popular kind and accounts for around one-third share of the global market.
        "Companies will continue to invest in capacity expansion and new product development in the years ahead to meet increasing and changing demands in this market," says a Fact.MR analyst.
        The United States bleaching clay market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.8% from 2024 to 2034. The U.S. is expected to become a significant market for bleaching clay due to an increasing preference for low-cholesterol oils among consumers.
        Throughout the forecast period, the rising yield of oilseeds will drive market growth in the country. The high concentration of activated bleaching clay producers, combined with extensive raw material production, is anticipated to further boost the overall market growth.

The partnership will pave the way for the rapid and efficient implementation of the project. Worley specializes in engineering, construction and implementation of complex industrial plants and, with 50,000 employees worldwide, has completed more than 1,000 projects in the chemical and resources industries across all continents. These include projects in the major chemical clusters in eastern and south-western Germany. The team is also one of few experts with experience in the implementation of lithium projects.
        To date, lithium converters have mainly been in operation in China and Australia. With a capacity of 24,000 tons of lithium hydroxide per year, the plant in Guben, Brandenburg, is an important building block for a resilient European battery value chain. By 2030, 50% of the material used will come from recycled batteries. The investment costs amount to around 800 million euros. The state and federal governments have awarded funding of 100 million euros to ensure a level playing field in international competition.
        Kerstin Wedemann, Chief Legal & Operations Officer, comments: "We are excited to develop our relationship with Worley and we are confident that together we will achieve success for our Project. Worley has a pedigree as a world class global project delivery partner. They provide full services until commercial operation. The international team will be supported by Worley's Germany office, taking care of the specific needs at a German site."
        Rock Tech plans to start project execution of the converter this year once the financing has been completed. The project received full permit approvals of the Brandenburg State Environmental Agency in May 2024 and has completed comprehensive basic engineering (FEL3 study). The technical specification for construction and commissioning has been completed, and planning for ramp-up and operation of the future converter has started.
        The EPCM selection process, coordinated by Accenture, took over six months to complete. Worley was selected against several competitors. Key criteria in the selection process included previous track record in complex projects, technical expertise and experience in implementing projects in Germany.
        Rock Tech's vision is to supply the electric vehicle and battery industry with sustainable, locally produced lithium, targeting a 100% recycling rate. To ensure resilient supply chains, the company plans to build lithium converters at the doorstep of its customers, beginning with the Company's proposed Lithium Hydroxide Converter in Guben, Brandenburg, Germany. The second Converter is planned to be built in Red Rock, Ontario, Canada. Rock Tech Lithium plans to source raw material from its own Georgia Lake spodumene project in the Thunder Bay Mining District of Ontario, Canada, and procure from other ESG-compliant mines. Ultimately, Rock Tech's goal is to create a closed-loop lithium production system. Rock Tech has gathered one of the strongest teams in the industry to close the most pressing gap in the clean mobility story. The Company has adopted strict environmental, social and governance standards and is developing a proprietary refining process to increase efficiency and sustainability further.

        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - In a shipyard in Yingkou, a coastal city in China's northeastern Liaoning Province, XCMG Crane, a subsidiary of XCMG Machinery unveiled its 4,000-tonne crawler crane, the XGC88000, now configured with a luffing jib. This crane has achieved a milestone by successfully lifting an 18MW offshore wind turbine, marking its first foray into this application. The achievement sets global records for both the diameter and the power per unit of the turbine, signaling its readiness for commercial deployment.
        The 18 MW offshore wind turbine, weighing close to 800 tonnes, features a hub center height of 145 meters and a blade tip height of nearly 270 meters. At optimal wind speeds, it generates 44 kWh of electricity per revolution. Annually, a single turbine can produce approx. 74 million kWh of clean electricity, sufficient to meet the energy needs of 40,000 households. This is equivalent to saving about 25,000 tonnes of standard coal and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by approx. 60,000 tonnes each year.
        To address the ultra-high, super-heavy, and high precision requirements of the project, XCMG has, for the first time, utilized the XGC88000 crawler crane in luffing jib working conditions. This marks the first instance within the industry that a 4,000-tonne crane has been applied in such conditions.
        The installation of the world's longest blade, measuring 126 meters, represents a challenging and critical phase in the entire lifting process. The task is akin to threading a needle at high altitudes, requiring the precise insertion of more than 170 bolts into their corresponding holes in the hub at nearly 150 meters above ground. Additionally, the blade is subject to swaying due to sea breezes during the installation, posing a risk of damage if not carefully managed. These factors combined to make the lifting operation extremely challenging.
        The XGC88000 performed reliably, and with the support of auxiliary cranes, the processes of lifting, slewing, centering, and positioning were executed smoothly and efficiently. This operation was accomplished in one attempt and earned unanimous praise from both the project owner and the construction crews.

        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - Inhance Technologies welcomes the opportunity to engage with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding today's announcement that EPA will commence a proceeding under Section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to further evaluate the fluorination of plastic containers. In particular, EPA has stated its intent to solicit information on this technology, including how fluorinated containers are used and whether measures may be appropriate to address any potential risk due to minute impurities of some perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that may be generated by use of the technology. Nothing in EPA's announcement indicates that the agency has made a decision to ban or restrict the fluorination of plastic containers or the sale or use of such containers.
        Inhance Technologies will work with EPA, along with others in the industry, to provide information about the fluorination of plastic containers. We are confident that Inhance Technologies' fluorination technology does not present a risk to the public or the environment. In fact, fluorination of plastic containers provides important benefits to the national economy. For example, as compared to other barrier technologies, fluorination is less resource intensive and has a lower carbon footprint. Additionally, the strong and consistent barrier provided by the fluorination process also prevents human and environmental exposure to volatile chemicals that are stored in fluorinated articles during transportation, storage, and use.
        EPA took this action in response to a citizen petition, filed by environmental groups, that seeks an immediate ban on the use of fluorination of plastic containers based on the baseless allegations that the technology poses an unreasonable risk. These environmental groups seek to deny access to fluorinated containers, which are critical to many industries from healthcare to crop protection, and whose supply chain partners would be left without viable alternatives for effective barrier protection, including for applications such as vaccines, pesticides, and fuel systems.
        Inhance shares EPA's interest in ensuring that any risks associated with three specific PFAS compounds   perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA)   are appropriately evaluated and managed consistent with TSCA and the agency's own regulations. To the extent such compounds are inadvertently formed during the fluorination process, they are only formed as impurities at minute concentrations.  Inhance is confident that any further evaluation of the potential risk associated with these compounds by EPA will conclude that there is no unreasonable risk associated with the use of fluorinated containers.

""")
st.markdown("""
        Tuesday - July 16: (RWE) - A new study by economists at UC Berkeley and the U.S. Naval Academy found California drivers could expect to save 20 cents per gallon if the state allowed gas stations to sell E15 fuel   a blend of 15 percent ethanol and 85 percent gasoline approved in all 49 other states.
        The potential savings for California consumers could reach USD2.7 billion annually, according to the study authored by David Zilberman, PhD, a distinguished professor in the Agricultural and Resources Economics Department at UC Berkeley, and Scott Kaplan, PhD, assistant professor in the Economics Department at the United States Naval Academy.
        "Consumers have the potential to gain significantly from the introduction and purchase of E15," according to the study. "In particular, our estimates suggest an approximately 20 cents per gallon discount for E15 compared with E10 after adjusting for energy content." The authors also highlighted the benefit of E15's lower carbon emissions. "In California, price savings for lower GHG intensity fuels are larger, likely due to California-specific policies incentivizing low carbon fuels."
        California is the last remaining state to limit ethanol inclusion in gasoline to just 10 percent (E10), but state regulators are considering approval of E15 after extensive vehicle testing showed the fuel offers important emissions benefits. E15 is legally approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use in all cars, pickups, SUVs and vans manufactured in the last 24 years.
        The study, sponsored by the Renewable Fuels Association, details the economic viability and implications of adopting E15 in California by analyzing fuel characteristics, market dynamics, and regulatory influences. Beyond direct cost savings, researchers found that increased use of ethanol-blend biofuels lowers gasoline usage, enhances energy security and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
        "Based on this study's results, a typical California household could save USD200 per year on their gas bill if state regulators would simply allow drivers to fuel up on E15," said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper, noting that more than 24 million registered vehicles in California are already approved to use E15, but stations are not allowed to sell it. "It's time for California to catch up to the other 49 states that already allow consumers to choose lower-cost, lower-carbon E15. The state's failure to approve the use of E15 essentially amounts to a gas price hike at a time when hardworking Californians can least afford it."
        The study also found that "low-income commuters may stand to gain the most from a transition towards E15," given their propensity to have longer commutes and less fuel-efficient vehicles.
        An earlier study commissioned by the California Air Resources Board found that adopting E15 in California could also provide significant environmental benefits, cutting emissions of tailpipe pollutants like particulate matter and carbon monoxide that cause air quality and human health problems.
